My name is Mohamed Burhan and I am an adaptable college student currently studying computer science at Cosumnes River College. I had the privilege of working for different companies in various roles, where I learned valuable professional technical and overall workspace skills. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven problem-solving, critical thinking, and creative thinking skills, which I hope to leverage into any job I work at.

Skills: C / Python / JavaScript / HTML / CSS / SQL
